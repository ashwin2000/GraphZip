# GraphZip
A Clique based Sparse Graph Compression Method


The program above is an implementation of the following paper:

You may not notice much of a memory difference for the graph which we have input, since this method is intended for large graphs. In our case there was a reduced memory usage of 30 bytes but if it were a larger directed graph then the memory reduction would be way more significant.

We can find these larger graphs nowadays in a lot of entities esoecially in social network graphs.

run main.py for results
